4. G1


Through Put  - number transaction per seconds
Latency  - transaction time for second 


G1 :
Five major improvements since java 8
1. String deduplicaiton
2. Class Unloading with concurrent mark

3. eagerly reclaim the humangous region   - Java 9
4. Adaptive start of concurrent mark      - Java 9
